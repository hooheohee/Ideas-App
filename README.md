### Ideas-App
An idea app built with Angular, NestJS and Postgres.  
Thanks a lot for [Kevin Mai](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBeQxJQNprbiJm55q7nTAfhMmzIC8MWxc)'s awesome youtube tutorials. Learned a great deal on angular/nestjs.

### Start the app
1. At `/backend`, run `yarn` and then `yarn start:dev`
2. At `/frontend`, run `yarn` and then `ng serve -o`
3. To start the GraphQL server, navigate to `http://localhost:4000/graphql`
